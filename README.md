## What is Bowly for? 
Bowly is a website, that calculates results of ten-pin bowling games and displays them.
The goal for this project was to display data in an easy to understand way.

## How I worked on this project

### Research
  - I started by researching ten-pin bowling scoring.
  - I researched example scorecards, bowling apps and websites.
### Design
  - To provide optimal UX, I decided that we need 2 views: one for upload, one for display.
  - UI design was made in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/mp5YlcTgNQ3WuB4kXyXQpT/bowly?node-id=0%3A1&t=QzNN1qkgQMGBA13p-1
  - UI is loosely based on Apple's homepage: https://www.apple.com/
